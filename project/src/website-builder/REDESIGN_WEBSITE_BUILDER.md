Hell yes — you’re in the **"live-dev-server-as-a-service"** zone, and that *absolutely* calls for a smart, tight system design. This is **not** a static web builder — this is a mini multi-tenant PaaS. Let’s go.

## 💡 Key Components

### 1. **Sandbox Orchestrator (Control Plane)**

This is your boss process. Handles:

* Spinning up containers with uploaded code
* Assigning ports
* Tracking running dev servers
* Killing idle/inactive processes
* Routing metadata (for proxy config)

> Build this in Node/Go/Python — doesn’t matter. Just make it robust.

---

### 2. **Containerized Dev Server**

You want **one container per user/project**, running isolated:

* Build a base Docker image:

  ```Dockerfile
  FROM node:20
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install
  CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
  ```

* When user uploads code:

  * Extract to `/tmp/projects/<user-id>/<project-id>`
  * Spawn container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      -p 3001:3000 \
      -v /tmp/projects/user123:/app \
      --name user123-dev \
      your-node-dev-image
    ```

> 👇 You can get fancier later with Kubernetes, but Docker is 💯 for early days.

---

### 3. **Reverse Proxy (Dynamic)**

You need a reverse proxy to route requests like:

```
user123.preview.yourapp.com → localhost:3001
user456.preview.yourapp.com → localhost:3002
```

**Options:**

* 🔥 **Traefik** — supports dynamic routing via labels + service discovery
* 🧱 **NGINX** — requires template generation + reload (use OpenResty/Lua if dynamic)

Or even:

* 🧼 **Your own lightweight Node reverse proxy** (for MVP only — trust me, you’ll regret scaling it)

---

### 4. **AI Code Editor**

* Expose endpoints like:

  ```
  POST /edit-code
  {
    "userId": "123",
    "projectId": "abc",
    "path": "src/components/Hero.tsx",
    "instruction": "Change button to say 'Join Now'"
  }
  ```
* AI logic:

  * Read file
  * Inject prompt with current code + instruction
  * Modify via GPT-4 + AST (ts-morph, Babel)
  * Write back
  * Rebuild project (if needed)
  * Reload preview (simple webhook or rebuild trigger)

---

## 🧠 Extras to Plan For

### ✅ Process Lifecycle:

* Auto-kill dev servers after inactivity (say 10 min)
* Websocket ping or heartbeat to keep active

### ✅ Port Management:

* Track used ports in a small Redis cache
* Assign on-demand

### ✅ Domain Routing:

* Use wildcard DNS:

  ```
  *.preview.yourapp.com → your load balancer IP
  ```
* Let reverse proxy handle subdomain → port mapping

### ✅ Security:

* Sandbox the hell out of these:

  * `--no-new-privileges`
  * Disable network (unless you *need* outbound calls)
  * Use `seccomp`, `AppArmor`, or run under `gVisor` (if serious)

## TL;DR — STRONG OPINION

Start with this:

* **Docker per project**
* **Traefik for dynamic proxy**
* **Node backend managing uploads + AI edits**
* **Persist user projects on disk or S3**
* **Build AI editing interface later using GPT + ts-morph**

This is a **hard system to scale**, but very fun to build. Don’t bother with full Kubernetes until you have 100s of projects running. Docker + Traefik scales surprisingly well for MVP and early launch.
